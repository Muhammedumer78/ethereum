//GAS MANAGMENT

Gas management is also much improved with account abstraction. 
Not only can applications offer to pay their users' gas fees, but gas fees can be paid in tokens 
other than ETH, freeing users from having to maintain an ETH balance for funding transactions. 
This would work by swapping the user's tokens for ETH inside the contract and then using the ETH
to pay for gas.
