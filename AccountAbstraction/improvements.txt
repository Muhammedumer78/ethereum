"Account Abstraction unifies Contract Accounts and EOAs."
:It makes user accounts more ‘programmable’.
:You remove the logic of signing transactions from the account, and you “abstract” it out, hence 
account abstraction.
:This unlocks much more flexibility, you could code an account for multi-sig, 2-factor 
authentications, withdrawal limits, and expiration on keys… It is a bit similar to what Revolut 
Virtual Cards brought to credit cards.
:This is very very exciting because it allows the non-custodial blockchain UX to scale.
