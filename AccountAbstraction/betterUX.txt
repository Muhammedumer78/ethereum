Account abstraction allows for a better overall user experience as well as improved SECURITY 
because it adds support for smart contract wallets at the protocol level. The most important 
reason for this is that it will provide developers of smart contracts, wallets and applications 
with much MORE FREEDOM TO INNOVATE ON THE USER EXPERIENCE(UX) in ways that we may not yet be able
to anticipate. Some obvious improvements that will come along with account abstraction include
BUNDLING OF TRANSACTIONS FOR SPEED AND EFFICIENCY.

For example, a simple swap should be a one-click operation, but today it requires signing 
multiple transactions for approving spending of individual tokens before the swap is executed. 
Account abstraction removes that friction by allowing transaction bundling. 

Furthermore, the bundled transaction could approve precisely the right value of tokens required 
for each transaction and then revoke the approvals after the transaction completes, 
providing additional security.
