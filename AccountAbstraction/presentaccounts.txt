//ACCOUNTS ON Ethereum
Today there are two account types on Ethereum: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts 
(EOA, basically that last one is regular user accounts).

:For anything to happen on-chain a transaction must be initiated and paid for by an EOA.
:The way you control an EOA is through its private key. You use this private key to create
a signature that proves to the blockchain itâ€™s your account.


//SHORTCOMINGS

//Private Keys:

1)In this setup, your private key makes you vulnerable. If you lose it, you lose your account
and all your funds.

//Hard and fast Rules:

2)The main issue is that the system is rigid and hard-coded. You can implement multi-signature
smart contract wallets like Gnosis Safe, but the default is this: you get an account with a key
and if you lose your key, you're doomed.

//Custodial accounts are not ideal:

3)The alternative of custodial accounts like Coinbase is not ideal. If they get hacked, you have
the same problem. It's even worse than when many credit card numbers are exposed after a hack. 
Because you cannot implement maximum transaction amounts on a classic EOA account, the hacker 
could drain all your funds in one transaction. It's a single point of failure and makes it super
easy for governments to seize or freeze all your money arbitrarily.
