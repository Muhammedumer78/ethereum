//BACKGROUND OF ACCOUNTS

When the Internet first appeared, to create an account on a site you had to ask a moderator to 
create a login-password record in a database.
A little later people thought of doing this automatically, then there were emails and the 
opportunity to reset the password if you forgot it.
The same development can be seen in Web 3.0.
