//MULTISIG AUTHORIZATION: 

You can share authorization credentials across multiple trusted people or devices. 
Then the contract can be configured so that transactions of more than some preset value require 
authorization from a certain proportion (e.g. 3/5) of the trusted parties. 
For example, high value transactions might require approval from both a mobile device and a 
hardware wallet, or signatures from accounts distributed to trusted family members.

//ACCOUNT FREEZING: 

If a device is lost or compromised the account can be locked from another authorized device, 
protecting the user's assets.

//ACCOUNT RECOVERY:

Lost a device or forgotten a password?
In the current paradigm this means your assets could be frozen forever. 
With a smart contract wallet, you can set some pre-approved accounts that can 
authorize new devices and reset access.

//SET TRANSACTION LIMITS:

Specify daily thresholds for how much value can be transferred from the account in a 
day/week/month. This means if an attacker does gain access to your account they can't drain 
everything at once and you have opportunities to freeze and reset access.

//CREATE WHITELISTS:

only allow transactions to certain addresses that you know to be safe. This means that even 
if your private key was stolen, the attacker could not send funds to non-whitelisted destination 
accounts. These whitelists would require multiple signatures to change them so that an attacker 
couldn't add their own address to the list unless they had access to several of your backup keys.
