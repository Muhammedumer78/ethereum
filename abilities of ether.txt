//IT'S REALLY YOURS

ETH lets you be your own bank. You can control your own funds with your wallet as proof of ownership – no third parties necessary.

//SECURED BY CRYPTOGRAPHY

Internet money may be new but it's secured by proven cryptography. This protects your wallet, your ETH, and your transactions.

//PEER-TO-PEER PAYMENTS

You can send your ETH without any intermediary service like a bank. It's like handing cash over in-person, but you can do it securely with anyone, anywhere, anytime


//NO CENTRALIZED CONTROL

ETH is decentralized and global. There's no company or bank that can decide to print more ETH, or change the terms of use.

//

//OPEN TO ANYONE

You only need an internet connection and a wallet to accept ETH. You don't need access to a bank account to accept payments.

//AVAILABLE IN FLEXIBLE AMOUNTS

ETH is divisible up to 18 decimal places so you don't have to buy 1 whole ETH. You can buy fractions at a time – as little as 0.000000000000000001 ETH if you want.
