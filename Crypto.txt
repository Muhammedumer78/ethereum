//WHAT IS THE CRYPTOCURRENCY?

Crypto (short for cryptocurrency) is a new form of digital money powered by cryptography.
It all started in 2008 with Bitcoin. You could use it to send funds to anyone anywhere globally.
What made crypto different from normal bank transfers or other financial services like Paypal or Alipay is 
that there was no middleman for the first time.

Things are different with crypto.
Transactions directly connect sender and recipient without having to deal with any central authority. 
Nobody else will have access to your funds and nobody can tell you what services you can use.
 This is possible because of the blockchain technology upon which cryptocurrencies operate.
