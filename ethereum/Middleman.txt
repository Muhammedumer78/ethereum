//MIDDLEMAN:

A middleman is a central authority like a bank or government that intervenes in a transaction between the sender and recipient. 
They have the power to surveill, censor or revert transactions and they can share the sensitive data they collect about you with third parties.
 They also often dictate which financial services you have access to.
