//Banking for everyone

Not everyone has access to financial services. But all you need to access Ethereum and its lending, borrowing and savings products is an internet connection.

//A more private internet

You don't need to provide all your personal details to use an Ethereum app. Ethereum is building an economy based on value, not surveillance.

//A peer-to-peer network

Ethereum allows you to move money, or make agreements, directly with someone else. You don't need to go through intermediary companies.

Censorship-resistant

No government or company has control over Ethereum. This decentralization makes it nearly impossible for anyone to stop you from receiving payments or using services on Ethereum.

//Commerce guarantees

Customers have a secure, built-in guarantee that funds will only change hands if you provide what was agreed. Likewise, developers can have certainty that the rules won't change on them.\

//All products are composable

Since all apps are built on the same blockchain with a shared global state, they can build off each other (like legos). This allows for better products and experiences being built all the time.
