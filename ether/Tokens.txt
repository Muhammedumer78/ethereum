//ETH ISN'T THE ONLY CRYPTO ON ETHEREUM

Anyone can create new kinds of assets and trade them on Ethereum. These are known as 'tokens'. People have tokenised traditional currencies, their real estate, their art, and even themselves!

Ethereum is home to thousands of tokens â€“ some more useful and valuable than others. Developers are constantly building new tokens that unlock new possibilities and open new markets.
