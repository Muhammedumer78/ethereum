//MEET ETHER, ETHEREUM'S CRYPTOCURRENCY


Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency called ether (ETH). It is purely digital, and you can send it to anyone anywhere in the world instantly. The supply of ETH isnâ€™t controlled by any government or company - it is decentralized and completely transparent. New coins (also commonly called tokens) are issued only to stakers who secure the network.

Every action on the Ethereum network requires a certain amount of computational power. This fee is paid in the form of ether. This means you need at least a small amount of ETH to use the network.
